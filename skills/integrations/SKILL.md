## Adding New Integration Rules

When adding a new integration rule:

1. Create a new file in `rules/` using kebab-case naming
2. Follow the rule template structure from `templates/rule-template.md`
3. Include platform-specific configuration examples
4. Add troubleshooting steps for common issues
5. Register the rule in the appropriate table above
6. Run `pnpm lint:fix` to ensure compliance

### Example Integration Platforms

Consider creating rules for these popular platforms:

**Capability Rules**:
- Tailscale (mesh VPN)
- Home Assistant (smart home automation)
- Ubiquiti UniFi (network controller)
- OpenWrt (router firmware)
- pfSense (firewall/router)
- Docker (containerization)
- Kubernetes (orchestration)
- Synology NAS (network storage)

**Efficiency Rules**:
- Multi-platform deployment strategy
- Integration testing and validation
- Backup DNS and failover configuration
