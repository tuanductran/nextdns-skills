# Security Settings

Advanced threat protection and security configuration

Configure advanced security features to protect your network from various online threats.

## Core Protection Features

- **Threat Intelligence Feeds**: Block domains identified as distributing malware, launching
  phishing attacks, or hosting command and control servers using highly reputable intelligence feeds
  updated in real-time.
- **AI-Driven Threat Detection (Beta)**: Analyzes DNS queries and answers in real-time to detect and
  block malicious behavior.
- **Google Safe Browsing**: Use Google's technology to block malware and phishing domains.
  - **Caution**: It wasn't designed as a DNS-level blocker and may flag legitimate CNAME domains as
    scams. It can take months to remove a false positive.
- **Cryptojacking Protection**: Prevent unauthorized use of your devices to mine cryptocurrency.
- **DNS Rebinding Protection**: Prevent attackers from taking control of local devices over the
  Internet by automatically blocking DNS responses containing private IP addresses.
- **IDN Homograph Attacks Protection**: Block domains that impersonate other domains by misusing
  characters from different scripts (e.g., replacing Latin "e" with Cyrillic "е").
- **Typosquatting Protection**: Block domains registered by malicious actors targeting users who
  mistype website addresses (e.g., `gooogle.com` instead of `google.com`).
- **Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) Protection**: Block domains generated by algorithms used by
  malware to communicate with command and control servers.
- **Block Newly Registered Domains (NRDs)**: Block domains registered less than 30 days ago.
  - **Caution**: This may cause occasional false positives. If you plan to "set-and-forget",
    consider disabling this.
- **Block Dynamic DNS Hostnames**: Block hostnames from DDNS services. Note that DDNS services can
  still access their own update APIs.
- **Block Parked Domains**: Block single-page websites that often contain ads and low-value or
  potentially malicious content.
- **Block Top-Level Domains (TLDs)**: Block all domains under specific TLDs known for high malicious
  activity.

## Recommended TLDs to Block

Blocking these commonly abused TLDs offers protection without much risk to everyday browsing:

1. `.autos`
2. `.best`
3. `.bid`
4. `.boats`
5. `.boston`
6. `.boutique`
7. `.charity`
8. `.christmas`
9. `.dance`
10. `.fishing`
11. `.hair`
12. `.haus`
13. `.loan`
14. `.loans`
15. `.men`
16. `.mom`
17. `.name`
18. `.review`
19. `.rip`
20. `.skin`
21. `.support`
22. `.tattoo`
23. `.tokyo`
24. `.voto`

## Best Practices

- **Prevent Overblocking**: Avoid blocking features that have a high rate of false positives unless
  your threat model requires it.
- **Grandma Test**: A configuration is successful if it passes the "Grandma Test"—it should work for
  a typical user without constant manual intervention.
